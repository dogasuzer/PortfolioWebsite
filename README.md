# My Portfolio Website

My Portfolio Website is a vibrant and interactive CV that goes beyond a simple HTML website. It's designed to showcase my projects and provide contact information in a fun and engaging way. The focus of the website is on animations rather than extensive functionality, as the content is primarily limited to my projects and contact details.

## Features

- **Interactive Game**: Explore the Projects section of my website and enjoy a game I've created exclusively for visitors. Have some fun while checking out my projects!

- **Sketches and Animations**: I've incorporated sketches, animations, and vibrant colors throughout the website to make it visually appealing and enjoyable to navigate.

## Tech Stack

The portfolio website is built using the following technologies:

- **Next.js**: Next.js is a powerful React framework that provides server-side rendering, static site generation, and other performance optimizations.

- **Zustand**: Zustand is a state management library that offers a simple and lightweight solution for managing state in React applications.

- **Typescript**: TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript, enhancing code maintainability and catching errors during development.

- **Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid development by providing pre-built classes for styling elements.
